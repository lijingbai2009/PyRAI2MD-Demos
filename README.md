# Python Rapid Artificial Intelligence Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Demo
This is a demostration of running machine-learning nonadiabatic molecular dyanmics (ML-NAMD) simulation using PyRAI2MD.
These ML-NAMD simulations were used to investigate the subsituent effects on the [2+2]-photocycloaddition of [3]-ladderenes
toward a class of energy-dense molecule, cubane.(ChemRxiv *preprint*, doi:10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-lxsjk)
